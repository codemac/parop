The idea is simple:

Template data & Scheme data:

In a template file you'd have something like:

<html>
<head>
<title>myfile</title>
</head>
<body>
~(for-each display '(1 2 3 4))
</body>
</html>


In a scheme file you'd do the following:

(use-modules (my stuff))

(define (proc a)
  (for-each
#~
<li>This will be raw data for ~(item) that is repeated<\li>
~#
'(1 2 3 4)))

The hope is that you can essentially go back and forth, and generate
things like gsl / xnf with sxml instead of xml. We'll see how far we
get!

This is entirely inspired by MOP / iMatix / gsl.
